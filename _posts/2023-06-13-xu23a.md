title: "Multi-modal Pre-training for Medical Vision-language Understanding and Generation: An Empirical Study with A New Benchmark"
abstract: With the availability of large-scale, comprehensive, and general-purpose
  vision-language (VL) datasets such as MSCOCO, vision-language pre-training (VLP)
  has become an active area of research and proven to be effective for various VL
  tasks such as visual-question answering. However, studies on VLP in the medical
  domain have so far been scanty. To provide a comprehensive perspective on VLP for
  medical VL tasks, we conduct a thorough experimental analysis to study key factors
  that may affect the performance of VLP with a unified vision-language Transformer.
  To allow making sound and quick pre-training decisions, we propose RadioGraphy Captions
  (RGC), a high-quality, multi-modality radiographic dataset containing 18,434 image-caption
  pairs collected from an open-access online database MedPix. RGC can be used as a
  pre-training dataset or a new benchmark for medical report generation and medical
  image-text retrieval. By utilizing RGC and other available datasets for pre-training,
  we develop several key insights that can guide future medical VLP research and new
  strong baselines for various medical VL tasks.
