title: "Virus2Vec: Viral Sequence Classification Using Machine Learning"
abstract: |
  Understanding the host-specificity of different families of viruses sheds
  light on the origin of, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, rabies, and other such zoonotic pathogens
  in humans. It enables epidemiologists, medical professionals, and policymakers to
  curb existing epidemics and prevent future ones promptly. In the family Coronaviridae
  (of which SARS-CoV-2 is a member), it is well-known that the spike protein is the
  point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. On the other hand,
  the two traditional mammalian orders, Carnivora (carnivores) and Chiroptera (bats)
  are recognized to be responsible for maintaining and spreading the Rabies Lyssavirus
  (RABV). We propose Virus2Vec, a feature-vector representation for viral (nucleotide
  or amino acid) sequences that enable vector-space-based machine learning models
  to identify viral hosts. Virus2Vec generates numerical feature vectors for unaligned
  sequences, allowing us to forego the computationally expensive sequence alignment
  step from the pipeline. Virus2Vec leverages the power of both the \emph{minimizer}
  and position weight matrix (PWM) to generate compact feature vectors. Using several
  classifiers, we empirically evaluate Virus2Vec on real-world spike sequences of
  Coronaviridae and rabies virus sequence data to predict the host (identifying the
  reservoirs of infection). Our results demonstrate that Virus2Vec outperforms the
  predictive accuracies of baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
